Alright: all the elements are sorted and we need to try and find a specific element, right? That is a no-brainer: we need to go with a binary search approach.

Provided neither the matrix or the rows are empty, since a nice problem like this needs to get burdened by pointless requirements that boil down to the chore of writing an extra line to remove silly edge cases <_<

Now, the relatively tricky part here is that we do not have all of them in a single flat container, but in a matrix. We will actually then want to do 2 binary searches: one to find the row to be searched, one to search it directly.

To do so, I declared 4 variables:

row, meant to store which row will be searched, once we found one;
l, r will store the extremes of our search, initialised to 0 and m.size() - 1, respectively;
mid will store the on going average of l and r.
First round of binary search:

we go on until l < r [note that the first one has to be a strict comparison, unlike for the second search];
at each iteration we will compute mid as (l + r) / 2;
we will then compare and find that if t is bigger than the last element of the row we are checking (m[mid].back() < t), it is time to raise l up to mid + 1 and loop again;
specularly, if t is smaller than the first element of the row we are checking (m[mid][0] > t), it is time to lower r down to mid - 1 and loop again;
finally, if neithere condition is correct, we it means that m[mid][0] <= t && m[mid].back() >= t, which implies we are already checking the right row, so we just assign l = mid and break out of the loop.
Be as it is, once we are done iterating, we will store the value of the correct row to search in row, reset l and r and move on with a similar logic to parse this time on a more traditional way if the element is in the row or not: a match will have us return true.

If we exit the loop without any joy, we return false.
